    "In our previous lesson, we learned about some of Python's basic types: ints, floats, and booleans.  We sometimes call these scalar types (or atomic types) because they hold one indivisible piece of information.  Of course, things get much more complicated, and we often have to hold many pieces of information together in one place. In data science, we often have to store things like measurements over time, different attributes for a single person, or entire tables of data.  To do these things, we need to organize atomic types together into larger objects - these are what we call *composite types*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways to organize items into larger objects.  If I have n objects, I can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line them up in the order that I receive them and keep adding to these as I get more\n",
    "- I can put them in a container with a specific label or name for that thing, like a dictionary.\n",
    "- I can make a package of several of them that I can't add to any longer\n",

To represent a sequence in python, we actually have a choice of several object types: lists, tuples, arrays, and others.  The most general-purpose of these types is the list.  You'll end up using lists again and again, so it's important to know how they work.\n",
