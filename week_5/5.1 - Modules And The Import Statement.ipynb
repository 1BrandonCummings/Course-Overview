Large programming teams need to be organized, with different people in charge of different files.  Even if you're working on your own, you may want to divide up your code into separate files in an intelligent way, so different functionality goes in different places.\n",

When you do this, you are bringing code that somebody else wrote into your own program.  Now we'll see how to modularize your own code so that you can use it in other scripts, or so that other programmers can use it."
